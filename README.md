## 📖 My Cybersecurity Journey

My story began in the **8th standard**, long before I understood what cybersecurity really was.  
All I knew was one thing:

> **I loved hacking — not “ethical hacking”… just hacking.**

Starting as a **Bio-Maths student**, my curiosity for technology didn’t follow the normal academic path.  
I used to install random tools on my dad’s computer, break it, corrupt it, fix it again, and repeat — yet he never scolded me.  
My **first-ever attack technique** was *phishing*, like a typical script-kiddie exploring the digital world without limits.

Later, I searched for many cybersecurity-focused colleges but couldn’t find the right one…  
So I chose **Panimalar Engineering College (CSE Dept)** — and it became the **biggest turning point** of my life.

From my **1st year**, I started real cybersecurity learning.  
My seniors shaped my entire path:

### ⭐ People Who Built My Foundation
- Kabil Preetham K & Ogrelix Team  
- Sanjai S  
- Sanjith Roshan U  
- Amithabh D K  
- Rishyendra M  
- Akshitha RS & Malathi Balaraman  

Alongside them, I had strong personal support from my close friend **Kevin Harry A**, who consistently encouraged me and stood by me throughout my journey.

### ⭐ Turning Moments
- **Sanjai S** gave me my first major role: *Cyber Security Club Student Co-ordinator*.  
- **Amithabh** guided me step-by-step technically and mentally.  
- **Kabil Preetham K** opened a life-changing opportunity — my **first real-time project experience**.

These people transformed me from a curious kid → into a **serious cybersecurity professional**.
